#  print(my_set.issubset(your_set))  # this will check does members of first set is in 2nd set if yes will print True
#  print(your_set.issuperset(my_set))  # this will check and encompasses all member of first set is in 2nd set
#  print(my_set.union(your_set))  # this will cut the duplicate and will print whole member of both member in order
#  print(my_set.isdisjoint(your_set))  # this will check does both set have any same member if yes print false
#  if any member is in both sets it will print false means its opposite to issubset
# print(my_set.intersection(your_set))  # this will check how many member are similar and it will print similar members
